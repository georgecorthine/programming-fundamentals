# 🧭 Programming Fundamentals Roadmap

Welcome to your **AI-assisted programming fundamentals roadmap**!  
This repository guides you through 12 weeks of structured, project-based learning in **Python, Go, TypeScript, and React** — all with the goal of building a solid programming foundation that lets you **leverage AI effectively for development**.

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals

- Understand core programming concepts: variables, data types, control flow, functions, and OOP.
- Build confidence in problem-solving without over-relying on AI.
- Learn by creating small, functional projects that demonstrate understanding.
- Develop general knowledge in four modern languages & ecosystems.
- Use AI responsibly — as a teacher, not a crutch.

## 🗓️ 12-Week Roadmap Overview

| Phase | Language | Focus | Outcome |
|-------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Weeks 1–3 | Python | Programming basics & logic | Build 3 mini-projects |
| Weeks 4–6 | Go | Strong typing & concurrency fundamentals | Create CLI + REST API |
| Weeks 7–9 | TypeScript | Type safety & JavaScript ecosystem | Build CLI + API tools |
| Weeks 10–12 | React | Frontend development & UI composition | Build interactive UIs |

## 🐍 Weeks 1–3 — Learn Python Fundamentals

### 🧩 Key Concepts
- Variables, data types, loops, conditionals
- Functions and modules
- Lists, dictionaries, and sets
- File handling
- Error handling

### 🛠️ Projects
1. **Simple Calculator (Week 1)** — practice input/output and arithmetic logic.  
2. **To-Do List CLI (Week 2)** — handle files, lists, and basic CRUD.  
3. **Expense Tracker (Week 3)** — read/write CSV, format text output.

### 🧠 AI Practice Prompts
- “Explain why a for-loop is better than a while-loop here.”
- “How can I refactor this to make it more modular?”
- “What’s the time complexity of this list search?”

---

## 🦫 Weeks 4–6 — Learn Go (Golang)

### 🧩 Key Concepts
- Static typing, structs, interfaces
- Packages and modules
- Error handling and concurrency (goroutines, channels)
- HTTP and JSON handling

### 🛠️ Projects
1. **Word Counter CLI (Week 4)** — file parsing and text processing.  
2. **Contact Manager (Week 5)** — structs, slices, and error handling.  
3. **Task Tracker API (Week 6)** — build a simple REST API with `net/http`.

### 🧠 AI Practice Prompts
- “Help me write idiomatic Go code.”
- “Explain this panic message and how to fix it.”
- “Can you review this Go function for clarity and efficiency?”

---

## ⚙️ Weeks 7–9 — Learn TypeScript

### 🧩 Key Concepts
- Type annotations and interfaces
- Functions, modules, and imports
- Generics and utility types
- Working with APIs (fetch, async/await)
- Basic Node.js CLI development

### 🛠️ Projects
1. **Math Utilities Library (Week 7)** — build a small module with reusable functions.  
2. **API Fetch Tool (Week 8)** — fetch and display REST API data.  
3. **Weather CLI (Week 9)** — consume an API and display formatted terminal output.

### 🧠 AI Practice Prompts
- “Explain what this TypeScript error means.”
- “Convert this JavaScript snippet into safe TypeScript.”
- “What’s the right way to type an async function returning JSON?”

---

## ⚛️ Weeks 10–12 — Learn React

### 🧩 Key Concepts
- Components and props
- State and event handling
- useEffect, custom hooks, and data fetching
- Routing and reusable components

### 🛠️ Projects
1. **Mini Dashboard (Week 10)** — build reusable layout components.  
2. **React To-Do App (Week 11)** — manage state and local storage.  
3. **Weather Dashboard (Week 12)** — fetch and display live data from an API.

### 🧠 AI Practice Prompts
- “Explain how React state re-renders work.”
- “Suggest a cleaner way to handle form input.”
- “What’s the difference between props and context?”

---

## 💬 How to Use AI Effectively

| Scenario | Best Prompt Style |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Debugging | “Explain this error in simple terms and how to fix it.” |
| Refactoring | “How can I make this function more modular?” |
| Learning | “Compare Python lists and Go slices with examples.” |
| Exploration | “Give me 3 small project ideas using React and APIs.” |

---

## 🧠 Mindset & Habits

- **Start with curiosity.** Ask “why?” before asking “how?”  
- **Use AI as a collaborator, not a substitute.** Always read and tweak generated code.  
- **Document your learning.** Each folder includes a README for your reflections.  
- **Build in public.** Share your projects and progress to stay motivated.

---

## 📚 Suggested Tools

- **VS Code** with Python, Go, TypeScript, and React extensions.  
- **Git + GitHub** for version control.  
- **Homebrew** to install dependencies on macOS.  
- **Postman or cURL** for testing APIs.

---

## 🚀 After the 12 Weeks

When you’ve completed all 12 weeks, you’ll be able to:
- Read and write code in multiple languages.
- Debug, refactor, and improve AI-generated code.
- Design small projects independently.
- Contribute to open-source or AI-assisted development workflows.

---

### 🌟 Next Steps

- Explore **backend frameworks** (FastAPI, Fiber, Express).  
- Learn **databases** (SQLite, PostgreSQL).  
- Practice **system design** and **API architecture**.  
- Continue to use AI — but always verify and understand what it produces.
